# AppMap Skills

Agent skills for working with [AppMap](https://appmap.io) runtime recordings. Each
directory is a self-contained skill (a `SKILL.md` the agent reads, plus any assets).

| Skill | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| [`appmap-record`](appmap-record/SKILL.md) | Record runtime data from an application with the AppMap agents. |
| [`appmap-config`](appmap-config/SKILL.md) | Configure what gets recorded: `appmap.yml` (packages, exclude, shallow, output dir) and function labels, per language. |
| [`appmap-gold-traces`](appmap-gold-traces/SKILL.md) | Maintain a committed baseline of curated recordings ("gold traces") and bless it as code evolves. |
| [`appmap-review`](appmap-review/SKILL.md) | Diff a change's runtime behavior against the baseline and write an interpreted code review. |
| [`appmap-setup`](appmap-setup/SKILL.md) | Get a repository recording AppMap data: config, one unit and one integration recording, noise exclusions, and a repo-local skill with the working commands. |
| [`appmap-setup-review`](appmap-setup-review/SKILL.md) | Demonstrate a gold-trace review on an existing change: set up recording and gold traces on a BASE commit, replay onto HEAD, and run `appmap-review` between them. |

## Use with Claude Code

Symlink (or copy) the skills you want into `~/.claude/skills`, then invoke them by name:

```sh
ln -s "$PWD/appmap-review" ~/.claude/skills/appmap-review
```

## Use in CI

The [`getappmap/review-action`](https://github.com/getappmap/review-action) GitHub
Action installs these skills and runs `appmap-gold-traces` + `appmap-review` on a pull
request.
