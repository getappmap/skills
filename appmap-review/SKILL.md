# Skill: AppMap Behavioral Review

Review the **runtime-behavior change** between two revisions and write an
interpreted, actionable code review. It works from **gold traces** — a curated set
of AppMap recordings committed in the repository (maintained by the
**appmap-gold-traces** skill) — so it catches the regressions that still pass the
test suite: a dropped authorization guard, a new query inside a loop, a
security-sensitive function that changed but gained no check.

A normal code review reads the diff. This review reads what the code *did at
runtime* on both revisions and reports what **changed in behavior** — grounded in
the AppMaps, not just the source.

Its sharpest use is finding **unintended side effects**: behavior that changed in
code the fix or feature didn't mean to touch. A diff review can't see these — an
unintended change is either invisible in the diff (an emergent consequence of a
shared helper, a changed default, an import) or hidden in it as something innocuous.
The behavioral diff is *intent-independent*: it shows what actually ran, which you
reconcile against what the change *meant* to do — and the unexplained remainder is
the side effect. Catching that residue is this skill's reason to exist alongside a
diff review.

## When to use

- Review a branch or PR for behavioral change and security risk before merge.
- Given two revisions (or one baseline and the current HEAD), produce the review.
- Investigate how a release changed server behavior versus a prior revision.

## Arguments

```
appmap-review <baseline-rev> [<head-rev>]
```

- **One revision** — it is the **baseline**; `head` defaults to the current `HEAD`.
- **Two revisions** — explicit `baseline` then `head`.

A revision is any git ref (SHA, branch, tag).

## How it works

The pipeline turns two revisions into one interpreted review:

1. **Resolve** `baseline` and `head`.
2. **Locate** each revision's gold traces in git history.
3. **Build an archive** of each revision's gold traces with `appmap archive`, which
   indexes them and bundles the **sequence diagrams (with labels), OpenAPI, scanner
   findings, and class map** — then unpack into a working directory as `base/` and
   `head/`.
4. **Compare** with `appmap compare`, producing the structural change report
   (new/removed/changed traces, SQL diff, OpenAPI diff, per-trace sequence-diagram
   diffs). The changed-vs-unchanged decision is made by a digest that **excludes
   volatile data** (elapsed time, object ids, parameter/return values), so timing
   jitter and unstable test data never register — a `changed` entry is real.
5. **Interpret** the compare output + the source diff into findings, following the
   **review recipe** below.
6. **Render** the scannable report.

## Locate the gold traces

Gold traces are committed AppMaps, by convention under
`gold_traces/baseline/appmaps/**/*.appmap.json`, alongside a manifest
`gold_traces/manifest.yaml`. Find them in each revision from git history
(don't assume the working tree):

```sh
# discover the gold-trace appmaps committed at a revision
git ls-tree -r --name-only <rev> | grep -E 'gold_traces/.*/appmaps/.*\.appmap\.json$'
```

Extract each revision's set into its own working directory, reproducing the layout
the project's `appmap.yml` expects: the recordings live under `appmap_dir`, and each
one's path *below* `appmaps/` in the baseline is its path *below* `appmap_dir`.
Preserve that sub-path — don't flatten to the basename, or two traces that share a
basename in different directories collide.

## Build the archives and compare

This exact sequence is verified against `@appland/appmap` ≥ 3.200.0. Run it from the
project root (which has `appmap.yml`). `$appmap_dir` is the `appmap_dir:` value from
`appmap.yml` (e.g. `tmp/appmap`); `$BASE`/`$HEAD` are the two revisions.

The project root may sit below the git repo root (e.g. `server/` in a monorepo).
That's fine: `git ls-tree` returns paths relative to the current directory, and the
`./` in `$ref:./$f` makes `git show` resolve them the same way.

The workspace lives under the system temp dir, NOT inside the repo — work files in
the repo tree can end up accidentally committed. The path is fixed (no random
suffix) so later commands and inspection can find it; each run starts by clearing it.

```sh
appmap_dir=$(sed -n 's/^appmap_dir: *//p' appmap.yml)   # e.g. tmp/appmap
review_root="${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/appmap-review"
rm -rf "$review_root"

# 1 — Extract each revision's committed gold traces into a per-revision working dir,
#     under $appmap_dir, preserving each trace's sub-path (no basename flattening),
#     and copy in appmap.yml so `archive` indexes both sides identically.
for rev in base head; do
  ref=$([ "$rev" = base ] && echo "$BASE" || echo "$HEAD")
  mkdir -p "$review_root/$rev/$appmap_dir"
  cp appmap.yml "$review_root/$rev/appmap.yml"
  for f in $(git ls-tree -r --name-only "$ref" | grep -E 'gold_traces/.*/appmaps/.*\.appmap\.json$'); do
    rel="${f##*/appmaps/}"                                # path under $appmap_dir
    mkdir -p "$review_root/$rev/$appmap_dir/$(dirname "$rel")"
    git show "$ref:./$f" > "$review_root/$rev/$appmap_dir/$rel"
  done
done

# 2 — Archive each side. archive's DEFAULT output is .appmap/archive/full/<rev>.tar;
#     do NOT pass an absolute --output-file (the internal tar mangles it). Just cd in
#     and pass --revision. archive runs the scanner and OpenAPI automatically.
( cd "$review_root/base" && appmap archive --revision base )
( cd "$review_root/head" && appmap archive --revision head )

# 3 — Restore each archive into <output-dir>/base and <output-dir>/head. `compare`
#     REQUIRES the two revisions' data to already sit there before it runs, and it
#     loads appmap.yml from its working dir — so put one there too.
#     Use `appmap restore`, NOT a manual `tar xf`: the archive nests the AppMaps and
#     their index files inside an inner appmaps.tar.gz, and restore unpacks both
#     layers. A single tar extraction leaves the inner tarball packed, and compare
#     then sees ZERO appmaps on both sides and silently reports only the API diff.
#     Don't pre-create the base/ and head/ dirs — restore refuses to write into a
#     directory that already exists.
mkdir -p "$review_root/out/report"
cp appmap.yml "$review_root/out/appmap.yml"
( cd "$review_root/base" && appmap restore --revision base --output-dir ../out/report/base )
( cd "$review_root/head" && appmap restore --revision head --output-dir ../out/report/head )

# 4 — Compare. base/ and head/ live UNDER --output-dir (here `report`); compare writes
#     change-report.json and diff/ alongside them. Do NOT pass --clobber-output-dir —
#     it would delete the base/ and head/ you just restored.
( cd "$review_root/out" && appmap compare --base-revision base --head-revision head --output-dir report )
# results: $review_root/out/report/change-report.json  and  $review_root/out/report/diff/
```

`compare` writes `change-report.json` (the structural facts) and per-trace diff
sequence diagrams under `report/diff/`. The diff sequence diagrams carry each
action's `diffMode` (added/removed/changed) and its AppMap **labels** — the primary
evidence for the recipe.

Note: captured values in gold traces are **sanitized** — each is a stable,
equality-preserving token (`<v1>`, `<uuid:v3>`), not real data. Reason from labels,
call structure, and SQL *shape*, never from a value's contents; equal tokens still
signal equal values (data flow), and both revisions are sanitized identically so a
token never registers as a change.

## Interpret — the review recipe

The compare output is *facts*; the **review is your interpretation of them** — what
each change means and what to do. A fixed findings table can't reason about a change
the way you can. Run all steps in one pass, then render.

Everywhere a step needs runtime evidence, read the **change report** and the
**per-trace diff sequence diagrams**, together with the **source diff**
(`git diff <baseline>..<head>`). The AppMaps are not background — they are the
evidence of *what changed*.

**1 — Feature List & intended scope.** Inspect the source diff, enumerate the
features and functional changes (application code only — not tests/config), and name
each as a complete declarative statement (e.g. "Added a gameByCode query that resolves
a private game by code"). Note which produced runtime drift in the compare — those are
higher-signal. Also capture the **intended scope** — the yardstick for Step 5: the
files/subsystems the diff touches (`git diff --name-only <baseline>..<head>`) and any
behavior-preserving claims in the commits ("refactor", "rename", "no functional
change"). A change that claims to preserve behavior but moves a trace is a finding.

**2 — Coverage Matrix.** For each feature, list the gold/manifest tests that exercise
it. ✅ covered; ❌ **uncovered** when a behavior that should be guarded has no trace —
especially a security-sensitive path with no *negative* test. For each gap, emit the
command to record the missing test.

**3 — Suggested Labels.** For functions that **changed in the compare but carry no
label**, suggest one so the next review can interpret them. Primary-language
application code only. → per label: `label`, `file`, `line`, `description` (why).
Take label names from the taxonomy in **appmap-config** ("Labels"), plus any
project-specific labels already in use (e.g. `security.join_code`). The same skill
has the syntax for applying them.

**4 — Suggestions (three domain passes).** Each suggestion: `file`, `line`, `type`
(bug | security | performance), `priority` (low | medium | high), `label` (a few
words), `description`, and the trace(s) it is based on (state if the runtime evidence
was used). Respect decisions explained in comments; don't suggest reverting to a
prior form; skip style/refactor/docs/test suggestions unless the improvement is large.

- **4a General** — focus on (1) bugs/errors, (2) security vulnerabilities, (3) performance.
- **4b SQL** — DB-related only; read the SQL diff + query nodes. Check for: N+1 /
  inefficient patterns; unsanitized input / SQL injection; dynamic SQL without
  parameterization; improper escaping; string-concatenated queries; lack of
  least-privilege; DB error-message exposure; hardcoded credentials; missing query
  timeouts; unbounded LIMIT/OFFSET; trust in user-supplied table/column names;
  `SELECT *`; missing audit on sensitive ops; no prepared statements; missing
  validation on filter/sort params; NULL/type mishandling; second-order injection;
  multiple statements per query; outdated drivers; uncontrolled metadata access
  (`information_schema`); poor batch error handling. Also use the recorded SQL to
  confirm what a performance fix claims: a LIMIT pushed down into the database
  shows up in the query text (for example `fetch next ? rows only`), and a fix
  whose query text did not change did not do what its commit message says.
- **4c HTTP** — request-handling only; read changed server/client request nodes.
  Check for: missing input validation; weak/absent auth; insecure transport (HTTP not
  HTTPS); poor session management; missing content-type checks; insufficient CSRF
  protection; open redirects; trusting `Host` / `X-Forwarded-For`; unsanitized input
  in query/path; verb tampering; caching sensitive data; verbose error leakage; no
  rate limiting; permissive CORS; unsafe multipart parsing; missing security headers
  (CSP, X-Frame-Options); misuse of status codes; untrusted-body deserialization;
  malformed-header handling; insecure file uploads.

**5 — Reconcile drift against intent (the side-effect check — the headline step).**
For **every** changed trace, ask: does the change map to an enumerated feature *and*
to code the diff actually touched (cross-reference the changed functions against
`git diff --name-only`)? That splits the footprint in two:

- **Intended drift** — explained by a feature and the touched code. Confirm it matches
  the work, then it's bless-able. Assign severity from impact: a *dropped* guard and an
  *added* guard carry the same label but opposite severity; the compare can't tell them
  apart, you can.
- **Unintended side effect** — behavior that changed **outside the stated scope**: a
  trace in a subsystem the diff didn't touch, drift that maps to no feature, or a
  "refactor/no-op" commit whose traces moved anyway. **This is what a diff review
  structurally misses** — the residue of footprint minus intent. Grade each:
  - *Acceptable* (🟢 note): mechanical propagation — an additive schema column appearing
    in unrelated `SELECT`s; a shared helper the diff changed reaching its call sites
    identically. Action: **confirm the blast radius** is intended, then bless.
  - *Concerning* (🟡/🔴 flag): a changed **call shape**, a new query/loop/exception, a
    dropped guard, or an ordering change — in code the change didn't mean to alter; or a
    behavior-preserving claim contradicted. These get a finding.

  → Suggestion fields; `type: side-effect`; cite the changed trace, the out-of-scope
  function, and whether it appears in the diff.

**6 — Absence findings.** The strongest *security* findings are often about what's
**missing**: a security-labeled function that changed but gained **no** guard, while
sibling paths did. Traces show what ran; cross-check the source diff for what *should*
run but doesn't. → Suggestion fields; usually `priority: high`, `type: security`.

Steps 5–6 are the headline findings; steps 1–4 are the scaffolding around them.

## Report format

The report is **findings-first**: the reader lands on the verdict and the actionable
findings; the evidence that backs them is one click away. The recipe above is
unchanged — this section is how its output is *rendered*. Four principles govern it:

- **Plain language, for a reader who has never opened this codebase.** The report
  is read by people who haven't read the diff, don't know this skill's internals, and
  may not know the application. Write every finding so that such a reader can follow
  it end to end without opening a file. Concretely:
  - Say what happens to a *person* before what happens to a *function*: "the person
    is logged out", "the key is not issued", "bob is created and then deleted again".
    Then name the code that does it.
  - Ordinary words over security or engineering shorthand. Not "fail-closed", "inherits
    the gate", "call shape", "footprint", "static residue", "blast radius", "guard",
    "negative branch". Say "both paths refuse the key", "gets the check from its
    parent class", "the order of calls changed", "code this PR didn't touch", "the
    test that checks refusal".
  - Introduce every name before using it: a function, a controller, a table, a page.
    One clause is enough ("`ApiKey.issue`, the one function that hands out keys").
  - Expand product terms on first use ("gold traces — recorded test runs that show
    which functions and queries each test actually executes").
  - The test: read the finding aloud to a colleague from another team. If it sounds
    like a design document, rewrite it.
- **Diagram the mechanism.** A finding about a sequence of steps, a branch, or two
  paths that differ gets an ASCII diagram, not a paragraph. Draw the real path from
  the recording: the steps in order, the point where the check fires, and where the
  two outcomes split. Mark what is tested and what is not. A diagram plus three plain
  sentences beats four dense paragraphs. Keep it inside a fenced block so it survives
  GitHub rendering; keep lines under 90 characters so it does not wrap.

- **Single home.** Every fact is stated exactly once. A finding lives in **Findings**
  and nowhere else — ledger and coverage rows *reference* it by number (`→ #2`). A
  cross-cutting caveat (first-ever baseline, partial trace set) is stated once in the
  banner and never restated. Test recommendations live inside the finding they fix or
  the coverage gap that motivates them — there is no separate tests section. A
  concerning Step-5 side effect **is** a finding (`type: side-effect`); an acceptable
  one is a line in the drift narrative.
- **Tiered rendering.** 🔴/🟡 findings get the full block (file, evidence, risk, fix).
  🟢 findings get one bullet each. A purely intended change that was considered and
  cleared is not a finding at all — it is the ✅ *Intended changes verified* row in
  the ledger.
- **Clean is a row, not a section.** A pass that found nothing (compare, side-effects,
  absence, SQL, HTTP) earns exactly one ledger row with a one-line note. Prose exists
  only where there are findings to explain.

Prose budgets: Feature List entries are strictly one line; **Background**, **What is
right**, **What is off**, and **Fix** are ≤ 3 sentences each; code blocks only for a
diagram or where the reader should copy-paste. Step 1's intended-scope notes are
working input to Step 5 — don't render them.

Keep the scannable idiom: emoji severity markers, ✅/❌ tables, clickable `file:line`
links. Structure (outer fence is `~~~` so nested code blocks can use normal
```` ``` ````; GitHub renders `<details>` folded in PR comments and job summaries, so
the detail stays accessible without being paid for on every read):

## What the change does

One paragraph, in ordinary words, for someone who has not read the PR: what a user
can now do or no longer can, which doors it applies to, and what stays the same.
Name the feature the way a person would, not the way the code does.

## Summary

| Severity | Findings | Action required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 🔴 High | … | … |
| 🟡 Medium | … | … |
| 🟢 Low | … | … |

One or two sentences: merge-blocking or not, and the single most important action.

## Findings

Numbered across all severities, ordered by severity.

### 1 · 🔴 HIGH — <one-line title, in plain words: what happens to whom>

**File:** [path:line](path) · **Evidence:** <trace name — or "source diff only"
when no trace covers it>

**Background.** Two or three sentences a newcomer needs before the finding makes
sense: what this part of the app does for a person, and which function or page is
involved (named once, explained once).

```
<ASCII diagram of the real path, drawn from the recording or the diff:
 the steps in order, the point where the check fires, where outcomes split,
 and which branch is tested. Under 90 columns.>
```

**What is right.** What the change gets correct, in one or two sentences, so the
reader knows the finding is not "this feature is broken".

**What is off.** What the evidence shows and why it matters, said from the person's
side first ("the person is logged out"), then the code's side. Who is exposed and
how reachable it is, in ordinary words.

**Fix.** The concrete change, then the regression test to add (≤ 3 sentences plus a
copy-paste block if warranted):

```python
def test_cannot_<bypass>(...):
    ...
```

### 🟢 Low

- **4** · <title in plain words> — [file:line](path) — one sentence on what is off,
  one on the fix. A low finding about a sequence of steps still gets the short
  diagram; drop the Background and What-is-right parts.

## Checks performed

The audit trail: every pass the review ran, one row each.

Row labels are plain words; recipe step numbers never appear in the rendered report.

| Check | Result | Note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Recorded behavior compared | ✅ no change · ⚠️ n changed, n new, n removed → #n · — not run | <one line, e.g. "run-to-run noise such as timings and generated values is ignored, so every reported change is a real difference in what ran"> |
| Behavior changed in code the PR did not touch | ✅ none · ⚠️ → #n | <one line> |
| Places that should have the check but do not | ✅ · 🔴 → #n | <one line> |
| Tests and recordings for the new behavior | ✅ · ❌ n gaps (detail ↓) | <one line> |
| Database queries | ✅ clean · ⚠️ → #n | <one line> |
| HTTP responses | ✅ clean · ⚠️ → #n | <one line> |
| Intended changes confirmed by a recording | ✅ | <one line — the cleared features, with their evidence> |

<details>
<summary><b>Review detail</b> — features, coverage, labels, drift</summary>

### Feature List

Numbered, one line each: **bold lead-in** naming the feature, then what it does.

### Coverage Matrix

| Feature | Covered by | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| <feature> | `test_name` | ✅ |
| **<security-relevant feature>** | **no test** | ❌ **uncovered** → #n |
| <client-only/untraced> | — | — |

(✅ a gold/unit trace exercises it; ❌ a behavior that *should* be guarded isn't —
especially a security path with no negative test; — out of trace scope.) One code
block with the record command(s) that close the ❌ gaps.

### Suggested Labels

- **`<label>`** — [file:line](path) `<fn>` — why.

### Behavioral Drift

Short prose: the **intended** drift (which traces changed as the feature predicts),
which subsystems held still, which traces are new — plus any acceptable Step-5
side effects (mechanical propagation, confirmed blast radius).

## Rules for the interpretation

- **Reason from labels + structure + source, never from a rule table.** A
  `security.authorization` change → reason about the auth implication; a removed SQL
  read → reason about what guard/data it provided; an `io.http` change → an
  external-call implication. The label names the domain; you supply the meaning.
- **Reconcile footprint against intent — this is the point.** The behavioral diff
  shows *everything* that changed; the source diff + commit messages say what was
  *meant* to change. The gap is the unintended side effect, which a diff review can't
  see. Always cross-reference a changed trace against `git diff --name-only`: drift in
  code the change didn't touch is the finding to chase. Distinguish mechanical
  propagation (acceptable — confirm the blast radius) from a changed call shape or new
  query/exception out of scope (concerning).
- **Severity is yours to assign** from impact, not from the label namespace. An
  *added* guard on a security path and a *dropped* guard on the same path carry the
  same label but opposite severity — the compare cannot tell them apart; you can.
- **The strongest findings are often about *absence*.** A security-labeled function
  that changed but gained **no** guard — while sibling paths did — is the
  ❌-uncovered row and usually the headline. Traces show what ran; cross-check the
  source diff for what *should* run but doesn't.
- **Coverage is path-dependent.** A trace only guards the branch it executes. A
  conditional gate (`if private: <check>`) is invisible to a trace that never drives
  that branch — so a clean compare on a happy-path trace does not clear a
  conditional guard. Flag the missing negative trace.
- **Cite evidence for every finding** (trace name + changed node + label + `file:line`),
  so the report is auditable against the compare output and the diff.
- **Write for a reader who has never seen the code.** Labels, node names, and recipe
  steps are how *you* reason; they are not how the finding is explained. A finding is
  finished when someone from another team can read it, look at the diagram, and say
  back what happens to the person and what to change. If explaining it needs a term
  like "fail-closed" or "guard", replace the term with the thing it stands for.
- **A clean compare is a valid report:** render it as ✅ rows in the checks ledger
  (noting that timing/value jitter is excluded by construction), rather than omitting
  the report — the ledger is what proves the checks ran.
